Members of The Returners, such as Seraphina "Swiftclaw," Thrain Stoneheart, Lirael Evenwood, and Garrick Ironfist, perform their duties covertly from within The Knight's Goblet Tavern.

Their goal is to ensure that the delicate balance between people and dragons is maintained. The Knight's Goblet Tavern serves as a cover for these activities, providing the perfect facade for their clandestine operations.

4. **Secondary Duties:**
   - In addition to intelligence gathering, The Returners in Leilon are involved in transporting and storing supplies and medicine.

5. **Connection to the Larger Organization:**
   - The Leilon chapter is just one part of the larger organization led by Zundaerazylym. The faction has a network of chapters operating in different regions, each contributing to the overarching goals of fostering harmony and safeguarding the existence of dragons. Zephyros Blackthorn maintains communication with other chapter leaders, fostering collaboration and coordination.
