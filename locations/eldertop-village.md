**Eldertop Village**

Nestled within the embrace of ancient trees, Eldertop Village exudes an otherworldly charm. The air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers and the murmur of leaves rustling in the wind. The village is a collection of modest cottages with thatched roofs and wooden exteriors, surrounded by lush vegetation.

Eldertop Village has a tight-knit community that values nature and harmony. Villagers are generally wary of outsiders but will open up to those who genuinely seek to help.

A short time ago a series of unusual illnesses started to befall the members of the village causing the local healer to require increasingly large quantities of supplies. The Returners (a local mercenary group) were supplying that aid before the last two shipments went missing (stolen by bandits), hence the player's quest to make the next delivery.

Furthering the woes currently befalling Eldertop, an entire family went missing from their home just a single night before the players arrived.
