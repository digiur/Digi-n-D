**Quest Title:** *Healing Shadows*

**Background:**
The village of Eldertop, nestled in the dense forest on the outskirts of Leilon, is facing a mysterious health crisis. The local healer has requested urgent medical supplies to treat a chronic condition affecting the villagers. Unfortunately, recent shipments sent from The Returners have gone missing. The players are tasked with delivering a crucial bundle of medical supplies to Eldertop.

Unbeknownst to the players: A black dragon has moved into the area causing the local maladies as well as a fog in the woods a little outside the village. More recently members of The dragon's cult have arrived; Lizard people who recently kidnapped and turned the missing villagers into zombies to unleash a shadow on the village. The cultists then left, thinking their mission accomplished.
